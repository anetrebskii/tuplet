# LinkedIn Post: Hive Agent Framework (Claude Code in your codebase)

I tried Claude Code and thought: "I want this inside MY product."

An AI agent that works with files, executes complex tasks, asks clarifying questions - but on MY server, with MY data, under MY control.

So I built it.

Introducing 𝗛𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 - a TypeScript framework for building AI agents, inspired by Claude Code architecture.

Here's what makes it different:

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿
Stop guessing what to write in system prompts. Battle-tested templates for multi-agent orchestration. Agents delegate, use tools, ask questions - all out of the box.

𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀
"Searching...", "Analyzing...", "Saving..." - your users see exactly what the agent is doing. Just like Claude Code.

𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸
Big task? Agent breaks it into steps, executes sequentially, reports progress. Users see what's done and what's next.

𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺
Built-in tools: list, get, write, validate. JSON Schema validation, custom linters. Agent auto-fixes files until all validations pass.

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲
Firebase Functions, Vercel, any serverless - it just works. History stored separately in Firestore, Redis, or PostgreSQL.

𝗦𝘂𝗯-𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀
Main agent delegates to specialized agents. Each with its own tools and even different models (Claude for complex reasoning, GPT-4o for speed).

𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴
Full execution tree: which agent called what, tokens spent, exact cost breakdown.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
Up to 90% cost reduction with Claude's prompt caching.

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗿𝘂𝗽𝘁 & 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁
User says "wrong direction" or "also do this"? Agent picks up context and continues. No restart needed.

𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿
Claude & OpenAI included. Need another? Implement one interface - done.

𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁-𝗶𝗻 𝗛𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆
Memory, Firestore, Redis, PostgreSQL providers ready. Conversation persistence without the boilerplate.

I'm building this in public and would love your input:
→ What features are missing?
→ What would make this useful for YOUR product?
→ Want to contribute? PRs welcome.

I'll be sharing more about the architecture in upcoming posts. Follow along if you're into AI agents.
